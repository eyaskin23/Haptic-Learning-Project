# Haptic-Learning-Project

This is a side project that I'm starting to learn more about robotics/hardware. 

My plans: 

1. User Assessment 
  - Conduct surveys, interviews, and even focus groups with piano learners as well as experienced players to understand their needs, pressure points, and desired features in a haptic instrument
  - Gather feedback from music teachers and educators to identify challenges students might face when learning to play the piano, and how to combat these issues 
2. Gesture Recognition and Feedback
  - Investigate gesture recognition techniques that can accurately track finger movements on a piano
  - Research methods to provide haptic feedback to users based on their finger positions and breathing patterns, ensuring that they are improving upon their skills and maintaining proper technique
3. Gamification and Motivation
  - Study how pleasure element (challenges, achievements, leaderboards) can further enhance the learning process and keep users motivated to practice
  - Develop a system (website/app) to keep track of other users and their progression, as well as your own/ incorporate a level system to keep the user motivated. 
4. Sensor Technology 
  - Explore the use of advanced sensors and actuators that can provide more feedback, such as stimulating real vibrations and resistance of a piano.
  - Delve into the integration of additional sensors to capture and analyze a player’s breath control and dynamics
5. Machine Learning/Error Detection
  - Develop machine learning algorithms that can analyze a learner’s piano playing and identity errors in fingering, rhythm, or intonation
  - Integrate these algorithms into the haptic instrument and receive feedback for improvement
6. Long-Term Learning Impact 
  - Conduct studies to assess the long-term effectiveness of the haptic instrument in teaching skills compared to traditional methods
  - Study how the brain either stores information taught by the haptic instrument as short-term memory or long-term memory and assess how to   better train the brain to store the information for a longer period of time.
